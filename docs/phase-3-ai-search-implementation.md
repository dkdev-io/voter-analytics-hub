- Rankings (top performers, leaderboards)
- Analytics (response rates, success metrics)
- Data Quality (issue detection, data validation)

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Enhanced useAIAssistant Hook
**Updates**: Added support for new AI services with fallback mechanisms

## üìä AI Query Understanding Examples

### Simple Queries
```
"How many calls yesterday?" 
‚Üí {tactic: "Phone", date: "2025-01-24", resultType: "attempts"}

"Team Tony SMS contacts"
‚Üí {team: "Team Tony", tactic: "SMS", resultType: "contacts"}
```

### Complex Queries
```
"Compare John Smith vs Mary Johnson phone effectiveness last week"
‚Üí Comparison query with person extraction and date parsing

"Show SMS supporter trends over time"
‚Üí Trend analysis with specific tactic and result type
```

### Data-Specific Responses
The AI now provides actual numbers from the user's data instead of generic responses:
- ‚ùå OLD: "I don't have access to your specific data..."
- ‚úÖ NEW: "Team Tony made 47 SMS contacts yesterday. This result has been added to the dashboard."

## üéØ User Experience Improvements

### Smart Query Building
1. User types natural language query
2. System shows confidence level and interpretation in real-time
